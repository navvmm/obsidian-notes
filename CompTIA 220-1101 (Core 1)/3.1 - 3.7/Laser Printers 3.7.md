**-- Laser Printer --**
Combine a laser, high voltage, charged ions, powdered ink, heat, and paper

Very high quality

Fast printing speeds

Although, very complex
- Many moving parts
- Requires on-printer memory
- Messy on the inside
---
**-- Imaging drum --**
Image is drawn onto a photosensitive drum
- "Painted" with a laser

Picks up toner
- Transfers toner to the paper

Can be separate from the toner cartridge
- Or combined
---
**-- Fuser assembly --**
Heat and pressure
- Melt plastic toner powder
- Permanently bond toner to paper
---
**-- Transfer belt and roller --**
Color laser printers
- Cyan, yellow, magenta, black

Four separate toner cartridges

Image is transferred from all cartridges to the single belt
- And then to a single transfer roller
---
**-- Pickup rollers --
Pickup paper
- Should be a single page at a time
- Problems if no paper is picked up or multiple sheets are picked

Should be periodically cleaned or replaced

---
**-- Separation Pad --**
Pull just the top sheet from the paper tray
- Not multiple sheets

Small and inexpensive
- Easy to clean or replace
---
**-- Duplexing assembly --**
Printers usually print on a single side
- Not both sides simultaneously|

Printing on both sides is a two step process
- Print side one, print side two

You need mechanisms to "flip" the page
- Automatically

Can be built-in to the printer
- Or available as an add on

**-- Steps --**
1. Processing
	- Nothing is moving, sending data to the printer itself.
2. Charging
	- A charge roller provides a negative charge to the drum and clears the drum to prepare the image provided by the laser.
3. Exposing
	- The laser begins writing the image to the photosensitive drum. The laser is creating a positive charge to the drum.
4. Developing
	- Toner in a toner cartridge is negatively charged will stick to the positively charged sections exposed by the laser.
5. Transferring
	- Transferring of the toner from the drum onto the paper.
6. Fusing
	- Paper passes through the fuser applying heat and pressure that melts the toner to permanently attach to the paper.
7. Cleaning
	- Might be some excess toner on the drum so the cleaning phase removes and excess toner that is on the drum.
