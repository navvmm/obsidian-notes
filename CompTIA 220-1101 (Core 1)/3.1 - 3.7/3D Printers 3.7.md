**-- 3D printers --**
"Print" in three dimensions
- Create a 3D item based on an electronic model

Additive manufacturing
- Build in layers to create the object
- No machining process required

Rapid prototyping
- Design and create relatively quickly and inexpensively

Deploy designs anywhere in the world
- Or into space
---
**-- Filament printing --**
Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)
- Melt filament to print 3D objects
- This is probably the printing type you've seen

Print a later, move up, print another layer
- Watch the printer create the object

Good all-around printer
- Larger print bed than resin printers
- Easy to manage filament
- Minimum of mess
- Fewer disposal issues
---
**-- Resin printing --**
Stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing
- Smooth and finely detailed 3D prints

Resin is hardened using a light source
- Ultraviolet light or a laser
- Layers are added to the bottom
- Entire print hands form the build platform

Resin must be handled properly
- Wear protective gear
- Take unused resin to your local hazardous materials disposal
---
**-- The print bed --**
A flat adhesive surface
- The foundation of a 3D print
- Everything builds on that first layer

Needs to be level and clean
- Prints "stick" to the bed

Filament printing
- The print bed is the printing surface
- Many different print bed options

Resin printing
- The "bed" is the location where the resin is hardened by the UV light
