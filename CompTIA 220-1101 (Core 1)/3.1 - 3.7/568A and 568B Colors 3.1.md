**-- Structured cabling standards --**
International ISO/IEC 11801 cabling standards
- Defines classes of networking standards

Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA)
- Standards, market analysis, trade shows, government affairs, etc.
- ANSI/TIA-568: Commercial Building Telecommunications Cabling Standard
- -http://www.tiaonline.org

Commonly referenced for pin and pair assignments of eight-conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted pair cabling
- T568A and T568B
---
**-- T568A and T568B termination--**
Pin assignments from T568-B standard
- Eight conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted-pair cabling

T568A and T568B are different pin assignments for 8P8C connectors
- Assigns the T568A pin-out to horizontal cabling

Many organizations traditionally use 568B
- Difficult to change in mid-stream

You can't terminate one side of the cable with 568A and the other with 568B
- This has never been the definition of a Gigabit Ethernet cross cable
