**-- Case Fans --**
Cool air is pulled through a personal computer
- Always check for good airflow

Motherboard layout becomes important

Component location is key
- Devices, wiring, power

Many different sizes and styles
- And volume levels
---
**-- On-board fans --**
Designed to cool an entire adapter card

Can be bulky
- May take additional adapter card space

Usually seen on high-end graphics cards

---
**-- Fan specifications --**
Standard sizes
- 80mm, 120mm, 200mm, etc.

Different speeds
- Variable speed

Different noise levels
- Not all fans sound the same
---
**-- Fanless / passive cooling --**
No fans, no noise
- Silent operation

Specialized functions
- Video servers, TV set top box, satellite receiver, media server

Functions are very controlled
- Carefully measured thermal tests

Low-power components
- Heat sinks
---
**-- Heat sinks --**
Dissipate heat through thermal conduction
- Copper or aluminum alloy

Fins/grid increase surface area
- Heat is then transferred to the cooler air

They get HOT - don't touch them!
- Especially when working on a device you just turned off

Thermal paste creates a good contact between the chip and the heat sink

---
**-- Thermal paste --**
Thermal grease, conductive grease
- Thermally conductive adhesive

Place between the heat sink and the component
- Improves thermal conductivity
- Moves the heat away from the component

A little bit goes a long way
- Pea-sized application
---
**-- Thermal pad --**
Conduct heat without the mess
- Cut to size and install

Easy to use
- Won't leak and damage components

Almost as effective as thermal paste
- But still very good

Not reusable
- Remove and replace
---
**-- Liquid cooling --**
Coolant is circulated through a computer
- Not a new concept
	- Automobiles, mainframe computers

High-end systems

Gaming, graphics
