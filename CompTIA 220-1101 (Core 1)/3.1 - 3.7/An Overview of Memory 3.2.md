**-- What is memory? --**
Random Access Memory (RAM) is the most common
- But it's not the only kind of memory

RAM is not referring to hard drive or SSD storage
- Don't mix the two terms
- Data is stored permanently on the drive

Data and programs can only be used when moved to RAM



**-- RAM slots --**
Memory types have changed through the years
- Driven by standardization and technology

One of the most important components of your computer
- Speed, speed, speed

Every motherboard is different
- Check your documentation
---
**-- DIMM --**
DIMM
- Dual In-line Memory Module
- Electrical contacts are different on each side

64 bit data width

**-- SO-DIMM --**
Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module
- About half the width as a DIMM

Used in laptops and mobile devices

**-- Dynamic Random Access Memory --**
The memory on the DIMM

Dynamic 
- Needs constant refreshing
- Without refreshing, the data in memory disappears

Random access
- Any storage location can be accessed directly
- Unlike magnetic tape

**-- SDRAM --**
Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM)

SDRAM is synchronous with the common system clock
- Queue up one process while waiting for another
- Classic DRAM didn't wait for a clock signal

**-- SDR vs DDR --**

---
**-- Double Data Rate 3 (DDR3) SDRAM --**
Twice the data rate of DDR
- Larger chip capacities - Maximum 16 GB per DIMM

No backwards compatibility
- Speed brings sacrifice




**-- Double Data Rate 4 (DDR4) SDRAM --**
Speed increases over DDR3
- Faster frequencies
- Maximum 64GB per DIMM

Again, no backwards compatibility




**-- Double Data Rate 5 (DDR5) SDRAM --**
Faster data transfers between the memory module and motherboard
- Maximum of 64GB per DIMM

The key (notch) has moved
- No backwards compatibility either
