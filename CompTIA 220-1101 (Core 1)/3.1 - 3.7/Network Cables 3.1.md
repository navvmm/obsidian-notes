**-- The importance of cable --**
Fundamental to network communication
- Incredibly important foundation

Usually only get one good opportunity at building your cabling infrastructure
- Make it good!

The vast majority of wireless communication uses cables
- It has to plug in somewhere
---
**-- Twisted pair copper cabling --**
Balanced pair operation
- Two wires with equal and opposite signals
- Transmit+, Transmit-/ Receive+, Receive-

The twist is the secret!
- Keeps a single wire constantly moving away from the interference
- The opposite signals are compared on the other end

Pairs in the same cable have different twist rates

**-- Copper cable categories --**

---
**-- Coaxial cables --**
Two or more forms share a common axis

RG-6 in television/digital cable
- And high-speed internet over cable
---
**-- Plenum-rated cable --**
Traditional cable jacket
- Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)

Fire-rated cable jacket
- Fluorinated ethylene polymer (FEP) or low-smoke polyvinyl chloride (PVC)

Plenum-rated cable may not be as flexible
- May not have the same bend radius

Worst-case planning
- Important concerns for any structure

**-- Unshielded and shielded cable --**
UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)
- No additional shielding
- The most common twisted pair cabling

STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)
- Additional shielding protects against interference
- Shield each pair and/or the overall cable
- Requires the cable to be grounded

Abbreviations
- U = Unshielded
- S = Braided shielding
- F = Foil shielded

(Overall cable) / (individual pairs)TP
- Braided shielding around the entire cable and foil around the pairs is S/FTP
- Foil around the cable and no shielding around the pairs is F/UTP

**-- Direct burial STP --**
Overhead cable isn't always a good options
- Put the cable in the ground

Provides protection from the elements
- Designed to be waterproof
- Often filled with gel to repel water
- Conduit may not be needed

Shielded twisted pair
- Provides grounding
- Adds strength
- Protects against signal interference
