**-- Intel and AMD --**
Two solid CPU manufacturers
- The differences are subtle

Cost
- AMD tends to be a bit less expensive

Different sockets
- The motherboard is designed for a particular CPU

Choosing a side
- Historically, AMD is value and Intel is performance
- This is a dynamic technology segment
---
**-- Server motherboards --**
Multisocket
- Supports multiple physical CPU packages
- Split the load

Memory slots
- Supports 4+ modules

Expansion slots
- Many slots and different sizes

Overall size
- Designed for a rock-mounted system
- Larger ATX-sized system
---
**-- Desktop motherboards --**
Can range from full-size motherboards to compact or monitor-only systems
- We can do a lot with increasingly smaller systems

Single CPU
- Reduces cost and complexity

Memory slots
- Usually two or four

Expansion slots 
- May have limited options
---
**-- Mobile motherboards --**
Laptops
- Small and light

CPUs
- Limited in speed
- Thermal throttling

Limited system modification
- Memory, CPU, functionality

Portability
- Smaller devices
- Low power consumption
---
**-- System board --**
Proprietary
- Built to fit

Replacement isn't easy
- Swap the entire board
- Most components are on the system board
