- Can't correct an error

Error Correcting Code (ECC)
- Detects errors and corrects on the fly

- It looks the same as non-ECC memory



**-- Parity --**
Even parity
- The parity bit makes an even number

First row has an even number of 1s so the Parity Bit will be 0

Second row has an odd number of 1s so the Parity Bit will be 1

Last row will also be a 1 for the Parity Bit



Valid or error?
