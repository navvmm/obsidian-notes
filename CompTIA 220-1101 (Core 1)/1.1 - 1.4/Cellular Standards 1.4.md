**-- Cellular networks --**
Mobile devices
- "Cell" phones

Separate land into "cells"
- Antenna coverages a cell with certain frequencies

2G networks
- GSM - Global System for Mobile Communications
- CDMA - Code Division Multiple Access

Poor data support
- Originally used circuit-switching
- Minor upgrades for some packet-switching
---
**-- GSM --**
Global System for Mobile Communications
- Mobile networking standard

90% of the market
- Originally an EU standard
- Worldwide coverage

Used by AT&T and T-Mobile in the United States
- Move your SIM card (Subscriber Identity Module) from phone to phone

Original GSM standard used multiplexing
- Everyone gets a little slice of time
---
**-- CDMA --**
Code Division Multiple Access
- Everyone communicates at the same time
- Each call uses a different code
- The codes are used to filter each call on the receiving side

Used by Verizon and Sprint
- Handsets are controlled by the network provider
- Not much adoption 
---
**-- 3G technology --**
3rd Generation
- Introduced in 1998

Upgraded data connectivity over 2G
- Incremental 3G updates improved speeds
- Usually several megabits per second

Bandwidth improvement allowed new functionality
- GPS
- Mobile television
- Video on demand
---
**-- 4G and LTE --**
Long Term Evolution (LTE)
- A "4G" technology
- Converged standard (GSM and CDMA providers)
- Based on GSM and EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution)
- Standard support download rates of 150 Mbit/s

LTE Advanced (LTE-A)
- Standard supports download rates of 300 Mbit/s
---
**-- 5G --**
Fifth generation cellular networking
- Launched worldwide in 2020

Significant performance improvements
- At higher frequencies
- Eventually 10 gigabits per second
- Slower speeds from 100-900 Mbit/s

Significant IoT impact
- Bandwidth becomes less of a constraint
- Larger data transfers
- Fasters monitoring and notification
- Additional cloud processing

**-- Updates --**
PRL updates
- Preferred Roaming List
- CDMA networks
- (i.e., Verizon, Sprint)

Allows your phone to connect to the right tower
- Can be updated over the air (OTA)
---
**-- Hotspot --**
Turn your phone into a WiFi hotspot
- Your own personal wireless router
- Extend the cellular data network to all of your devices

Dependent on phone type and provider
- May require additional charges and data costs
