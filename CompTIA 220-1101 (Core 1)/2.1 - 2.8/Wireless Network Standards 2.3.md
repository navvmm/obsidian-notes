**-- Wireless Standards --**
Wireless networking (802.11)
- Managed by the IEEE LAN/MAN Standards Committee (IEEE 802)

Many updates over time
- Check with IEEE for the latest

The Wi-Fi trademark
- Wi-Fi Alliance handles interoperability testing
---
**-- 802.11a --**
One of the original 802.11 wireless standards
- October 1999

Operates in the 5 GHz range
- Or other frequencies with special licensing

54 megabits per second (Mbit/s)

Smaller range than 802.11b
- Higher frequency is absorbed by objects in the way

Not commonly seen today

---
**-- 802.11b --**
Also an original 802.11 standard
- October 1999

Operates in the 2.4 GHz range

11 megabits per second (Mbit/s)

Better range than 802.11a
- Less absorption problems

More frequency conflict
- Baby monitors, cordless phones, microwave ovens, Bluetooth

Not commonly seen today

---
**-- 802.11g --**
An "upgrade" to 802.11b
- June 2003

Operates in the 2.4 GHz range

54 megabits per second (Mbit/s)
- Similar to 802.11a

Backwards-compatible with 802.11b

Same 2.4 GHz frequency conflict problems as 802.11b

---
**-- 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4) --**
The update to 802.11g, 802.11b, and 802.11a
- October 2009

Operates at 5 GHz and/or 2.4 GHz
- 40 MHz channel widths

600 megabits per second (Mbit/s)
- 40 MHz mode and 4 antennas

802.11n uses MIMO
- Multiple-input multiple-output
- Multiple transmit and receive antennas
---
**-- 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) --**
Approved in January 2014
- Significant improvements over 802.11n

Operates in the 5 GHz band
- Less crowded, more frequencies (up to 160 MHz channel bandwidth)

Increased channel bonding
- Larger bandwidth usage

Denser signaling modulation
- Faster data transfers

Eight MU-MIMO downlink streams
- Twice as many streams as 802.11n
- Nearly 7 gigabits per second
---
**-- 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) --**
Approved in February 2021
- The successor to 802.11ac/Wi-Fi 5

Operates at 5 GHz and/or 2.4 GHz
- 20, 40, 80, and 160 MHz channel widths

1,201 megabits per second per channel
- A relatively small increase in throughput
- Eight bi-directional MU-MIMO streams

Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)
- Works similar to cellular communication
- Improves high-density installations

**-- Long-range fixed wireless --**
Wireless access point in a house with the stock antennas
- You might get a range of 40 to 50 meters

Try connecting two buildings located miles from each other
- Fixed directional antennas and increased signal strength

Outdoors
- Minimal signal absorption or bounce

Directional antennas
- Focused, point-to-point connection

Wireless regulations are complex
- Refer to your country's regulatory agency

Frequency use
- Unlicensed 2.5 GHz or 5 GHz frequencies
- Additional frequencies may be available
- Additional licensing may be required

Signal strength
- Indoor and outdoor power is usually regulated

Outdoor antenna installation is not trivial
- Get an expert, be safe
---
**-- RFID (Radio-frequency identification) --**
It's everywhere
- Access badges
- Inventory/Assembly line tracking
- Pet/Animal identification
- Anything that needs to be tracked

Radar technology
- Radio energy transmitted to the tag
- RF powers the tag, ID is transmitted back
- Bidirectional communication
- Some tag formats can be active/powered
---
**-- NFC --**
Two-way wireless communication
- Builds on RFID, which is mostly one-way

Payment systems
- Major credit cards
- Online wallets

Bootstrap for other wireless
- NFC helps with Bluetooth pairing

Access token, identity "card"
- Short range with encryption support
