**-- SDN (Software Defined Networking) --**
Networking devices have different functional planes of operation
- Data, control, and management planes

Split the functions into separate logical units
- Extend the functionality and management of a single device
- Perfectly built for the cloud



Infrastructure layer / Data plane
- Process the network frames and packets
- Forwarding, trunking, encrypting, NAT

Control layer / Control plane
- Manages the actions of the data plane
- Routing tables, session tables, NAT tables
- Dynamic routing protocol updates

Application layer / Management plane
- Configure and manage the device
- SSH, browser, API
