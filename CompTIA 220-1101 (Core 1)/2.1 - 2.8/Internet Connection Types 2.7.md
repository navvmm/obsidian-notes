**-- Satellite Networking --**
Communication to a satellite
- Non-terrestrial communication

High cost relative to terrestrial networking
- 50Mbit/s down, 3 Mbit/s up are common
- Remote sites, difficult-to-network sites

High latency
- 250ms up, 250ms down
- Starlink advertises 40ms and is working on 20ms

High frequencies - 2GHz
- Line of sight, rain fade
---
**-- Fiber --**
High speed data communication
- Frequencies of light

Higher installation cost than copper
- Equipment is more costly
- More difficult to repair
- Communicate over long distances

Large installation in the WAN core
- Support very high data rates
- SONET, wavelength division multiplexing

Fiber is slowly approaching the premises
- Business and home use

**-- Cable broadband --**
Broadband
- Transmission across multiple frequencies
- Different traffic types

Data on the "cable" network
- DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification)

High-speed networking
- 50 Mbit/s through 1000 + Mbit/s are common
