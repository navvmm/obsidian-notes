**-- Satellite Networking --**
Communication to a satellite
- Non-terrestrial communication

High cost relative to terrestrial networking
- 50Mbit/s down, 3 Mbit/s up are common
- Remote sites, difficult-to-network sites

High latency
- 250ms up, 250ms down
- Starlink advertises 40ms and is working on 20ms

High frequencies - 2GHz
- Line of sight, rain fade
---
**-- Fiber --**
High speed data communication
- Frequencies of light

Higher installation cost than copper
- Equipment is more costly
- More difficult to repair
- Communicate over long distances

Large installation in the WAN core
- Support very high data rates
- SONET, wavelength division multiplexing

Fiber is slowly approaching the premises
- Business and home use
---
**-- Cable broadband --**
Broadband
- Transmission across multiple frequencies
- Different traffic types

Data on the "cable" network
- DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification)

High-speed networking
- 50 Mbit/s through 1000 + Mbit/s are common

Multiple services
- Data, voice, video
---
**-- DSL --**
ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)
- Uses telephone lines

Download speed is faster than the upload speed (asymmetric)
- 200 Mbit/s downstream / 20 Mbit/s upstream are common
- ~10,000 foot limitation from the central office (CO)
- Faster speeds may be possible if closer to the CO
---
**-- Cellular networks --**
Mobile devices
- "Cell" phones

Separate land into "cells"
- Antenna coverages a cell with certain frequencies

Tethering
- Turn your phone into a wireless router

Mobile hotspot
- Standalone device
- Use your phone for other things
---
**-- WISP --**
Wireless Internet Service Provider
- Terrestrial internet access using wireless

Connect rural or remote locations
- Internet access for everyone

Many different deployment technologies
- Meshed 802.11
- 5G home internet
- Proprietary wireless

Need an outdoor antenna
- Speeds can range from ~10 to 1000 megabits per second
