**-- Cable crimpers --**
"Pinch" the connector onto a wire
- Coaxial, twisted pair, fiber

Connect the modular connector to the Ethernet cable
- The final step of the process

Metal prongs are pushed through the insulation
- The plug is also permanently pressed onto the cable sheath
---
**-- Crimping best-practices --**
Get a good crimper
- And a good pair of electrician's scissors / cable snips
- And a good wire stripper

Make sure you use the correct modular connectors
- Differences between wire types

Practice, practice, practice
- It won't take long to become proficient
---
**-- WiFi analyzer --**
Wireless networks are incredibly easy to monitor
- Everyone "hear" everything

Purpose-built hardware or mobile device add-on
- Specializes in 802.11 analysis

Identify errors and interference
- Validate antenna location and installation
---
**-- Tone generator --**
Toner probe
- Where does that wire go?
- Follow the tone

Tone generator
- Puts an analog sound on the wire

Inductive probe
- Doesn't need to touch the copper
- Hear through a small speaker

**-- Using the tone generator and probe --**
Easy wire tracing
- Even in complex environments

Connect the tone generator to the wire
- Modular jack
- Coax
- Punch down connectos

Use the probe to locate the sound
- The two-tone sound is easy to find
---
**-- Punch down tool --**
"Punch" a wire into a wiring block
- 66 block, 100 block, and others

Can be tedious
- Every wire must be individually punched

Trims the wires during the punch
- Very efficient process

**-- Punch-down best-practices --**
Organization is key
- Lots of wires
- Cable management

Maintain your twists
- Your Category 6A cable will thank you later

Document everything
- Written documentation
- Tags
- Graffiti
---
**-- Cable Testers --**
Relatively simple
- Continuity test
- A simple wire map

Can identify missing pins
- Or crossed wires

Not usually used for frequency testing
- Crosstalk, signal loss, etc.
---
**-- Lookback plugs --**
Useful for testing physical ports
- Or fooling your applications

Serial / RS-232 (9 pin or 25 pin)

Network connections
- Ethernet, T1, Fiber

These are not cross-over cables

---
**-- Taps and port mirrors --**
Intercept network traffic
- Send a copy to a packet capture device

Physical taps
- Disconnect the link. put a tap in the middle
- Can be an active or passive tap

Port mirror
- Port redirection, SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer)
- Software-based tap
- Limited functionality, but can work well in a pinch
